Twitter on Feb 4 2014 rolled out a new whitish snowish gloassy design which many people like me didnt like.
I wrote a small script which changes some css so that twitter may look easy on the eyes.
Packed it in small extention so that I don't have to call it everytime :)

Google would not let me publish my add-on on the web store until I pay $5
So just publishing here until I feel like paying for google for publishing my tiny extension.
You can install this extention via .crx file or using the contents in the zip file
